# PersonWebApp

This is a simple WebApp made with ASP.NET framework and written in C#. It runs in https://localhost:7153 and it uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design. It consists of a welcome page, a search and a database view. 

The database uses a ORM approach, allows for CRUD operations and it is managed by SQL Server.

In order to try out some security measures it also has sign up and sign in functionality. These are “fake” so you can use any made up email to sign up. The WebApp will ask you to sign in to add, delete or update data from the database.

To execute the application, you can clone it and run it through Visual Studio or use the command  “dotnet run” when in the directory of the project.
